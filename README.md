# UltiRequiem's Setup

My current OS is [Archlinux](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/Archlinux).

## Shell

My current shell is [zsh](https://www.zsh.org),
and I use [Oh my Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) as framework.

## Scripts

My scripts are made with 3 different technologies: Python, Ruby and Node.js

Right now I am trying to pass all my scripts to Node.js.

I try not to have bash scripts (although I have some) since they are not so
maintainable in the long term and do not have all
the facilities of a normal programming language.
