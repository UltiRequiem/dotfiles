# UltiRequiem's Setup

My current OS is [Archlinux](https://github.com/UltiRequiem/Archlinux).

## Shell

My current shell is [zsh](https://zsh.org), and I use
[Oh my Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) as framework.

## Scripts

Some time ago I had my scripts written in JavaScript, using Nodejs. The problem
is that Nodejs is not installed on all the computers that I use while Python and
Bash are.

So I decided to try to pass all my short scripts to [Bash Functions](./.functions) and the other scripts to Python.
